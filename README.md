# Monkey-Type-Inspired Obsidian Themes

A collection of **Obsidian themes inspired by the popular MonkeyType aesthetic** — minimal, vibrant, and focused on readability & comfort.

Each theme is a standalone `.css` file you can install directly as a custom Obsidian theme.

## 📂 Included Themes

| File | Style / Vibe |
|------|--------------|
| `blue seas.css` | Cool blue palette with gentle contrast |
| `dino.css` | Fun, slightly retro aesthetic |
| `magic girl.css` | Bright, playful colors |
| `milk shake.css` | Soft pastel theme |
| `modern ink.css` | Clean, ink-style minimal |
| `ms cupcake.css` | Sweet pastel vibes |
| `suisei.css` | Darker contrast, smooth feel |

> Feel free to expand this list with more themes — contributions welcome!

## 🚀 Installation (Manual)

1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Move your chosen theme `.css` file into your vault at:
3. Open Obsidian → **Settings > Appearance**.
4. Under **Themes**, open **Manage** and select your theme.
5. Refresh Obsidian if needed (sometimes required for custom CSS to load).

## 📌 Notes

- These themes are **not in the official community theme gallery**; they must be installed manually.
- They are inspired by MonkeyType’s style and color vibes, but **not replicas of any trademarked assets**.

## 🛠 Customize Your Theme

You can tailor any theme using the **Style Settings** plugin — e.g., adjust fonts, accent colors, spacings, etc.

Style Settings compatibility allows you to make:
- Font changes (e.g., Mono vs Sans)
- Line spacing tweaks
- Color tweaks
- UI accent overrides

> If you want to add a theme with built-in Style Settings controls, that’s a great future improvement!

## 🙌 Contributing

Pull requests are welcome!  
Good starting contributions:
- Add a **preview screenshot** for each theme
- Add **Style Settings support**
- Add installation instructions for **theme managers/plugins**
- Create a **demo vault** with examples & screenshots
